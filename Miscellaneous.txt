Miscellaneous Tidbits

STATIC programming language 
    - When you declare a type, you are stuck with that type wherever it is declared. 

2 Operating systems
- Unix/Linux/Mac 
- Windows

8 bits is a byte. 

32-bit vs 64-bit processor
    - 32 is old.
    - 64 is new. Means computer can process 64 bits at once.

GOROOT 
    - points to the binary of your go language. 

Integrated Development Environment
    - VS Code 
    - Goland

Every program needs 'package main & func main()'

Variadic Parameter: 
    - ...interface{} (any number of things of any type)

Types: 
    - types are the heart of golang.
    - Primitive / Basic / Built-in :: number, bool, string 
    - Composite :: Array, Slice, Map, Struct (differentiates by having values of variable type)
    - Zero-Value: bool (false), string (empty), int (0), float (0.0) pointers, structs, arrays, etc (nil)

HOW COMPUTERS WORK
    - circuit, switch, transistor are all synonymous
    - Bits == Binary Digits
    - Machine Language == binary
    - UTF-8 (first part of it is ascii), made by people who made Go 
    - 1 Bit (binary digit) // 8 bits = byte // 1000 bytes = 1KB (1024, actually) // ... MB ... GB ... TB
    - debugging :: Grace Hopper
    - 2.6 billion in size of thumbnail... circuits on a chip. 
    - Intel == integrated electronics  
    - "word size" :: the number of bits it can read at once

GO HISTORY
    - 2006 Intel, dual cores widely available
    - Go was developed in 2007 to take advantage of the dual core processes
    - Concurrency is at the heart of this language -- concurrency easy
    - March 2012 Go v 1 released
