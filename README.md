# Golang Udemy Course

## Reason for taking
- 1) Go is my favorite language.
- 2) I felt comfortable generating servers in Go, but shaky on the foundations (particularly concurrency)
- 3) I prefer to start at the beginning, even if it means going back

## Why include on Github?
- Purely to demonstrate independent work I've been doing in the last few weeks, in addition to coding challenges for companies in SF 

## What is next?
- 1) A movie review website, which will implement Go's built-in concurrency
- 2) Taking Todd's 2nd course "Golang Web Development"
